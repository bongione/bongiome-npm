A couple of minutes ago I was thinking about the changes in approach to Mindiply I'm thinking about.
These days I'm also listening to the **Decisive** audiobook by the Heath brothers, about cognitive biases and 
decision-making.

As I was thinking about it an email came in from the Happy startup school. It was about a few points
raised by a chap who does marketing for hippies. A lot of what was said resonated with me, indeed seemed
to validate the change in approach I am thinking about - like being genuine, human, happy to be a fit
for some people and not for others.

And as I had this warm feeling of validation percolating through my body, I mocked, gently, but still mocked 
myself, telling myself - and this is how confirmation bias happens.

And then I retorted back, are you so afeared of your biases? Are you not only affected by them unconsciously,
but also let them limit your potential action because you suspect you are triggering them?

In the past few years, as I look back on it, I had similar thoughts a number of times. You take a decision, you
look back, and wonder, is it because I'm a delusional optimist. I mean, some may argue that if you have
a startup that's what you're supposed to be, and you may get a chuckle out of me, because yeah, there is some
element of truth, or at least credibility as you say it.

I am giving myself before taking the plunge with the decision of changin how I approach marketing and
product discovery in Mindiply, because I myself know I need to attain some distance. I suspect I will
probably follow [this new direction]({{<ref "pushers_and_pullers">}}). One thing I know though, is that this time at least I will take the plunge
knowing the risks, and accepting that part of the motivation for doing so is to better motivate myself,
make it more fun as a process.
