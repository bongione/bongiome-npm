- My dad often anchors his opinion on those of smarter people.
- Sometimes it's discouraging thinking because you're not sure that you will create something useful.
- yet, luckily, people keep doing and come occasionally with new useful angles.
- And you have explored a topic a bit on your own, made it more yours.
- You don't necessarily always need to share - which is why I'm sharing this now.
- You have to form opinions, relying on someone else to do the thinking for you can be dangerous
- Being a questioner can be useful in this case, you can smell things that are not quite right
