My son is seven and a half years old. Earlier, I was thinking about what to
write about on this website, and a prominent topic is life as a parent of an
autistic child who has severe learning difficulties.

Shame - an old friend who frequently pays a visit -  told me that,
indeed, I know far too little about autism to talk with any authority about it.
I can act as a sample, and some of the tips I discovered
or was taught may work for other parents, but that's about it.

So, bypassing the regrets of my late start on the topic, thanking 
yet again, my wife for being much more switched on in her role as a parent
than I am -she has read and is reading plenty about autism- I promise
myself to be better in the months and years to come.

And I want to do it concretely. So that's my pledge to myself [^1], made public to the internet and to my friend Shame for when he visits again in the future:

~~~
Today, I will briefly summarise what I understand of autism,
after seven and a half years of parenting our autistic son.

I will, in the next 3 years, gain a better understanding of what
the current scientific consensus, thinking and research
directions are around autism, especially in terms of what
interventions have received empirical support or are looking 
promising.

Once every three months, I will report the progress here and will 
try to synthesise my findings in a separate section of the website,
together with a directory of the resources I've discovered during 
my research.

## My current understanding of autism

I will try to briefly summarise what my understanding of autism is as of today.
When I say this is my current understanding, I'm trying to convey that I need clarification on its validity. Given how little I know about it, it runs potentially contrary to the current scientific and educational consensus.

This summary is informed by:
1. My day-to-day life as a dad with an autistic son.
2. Second-hand knowledge from my diligent wife.
3. Tips and tricks from other parents, educators and health professionals.
4. Minimal reading from parenting books focused on children with autism.
5. Minimal research on Google Scholar about scientific literature around autism.

Autism is a condition with a broad spectrum that affects the social and cognitive abilities of a person in several ways:

1. **Underdeveloped or hyper-developed sensory input** Persons with autism often have one or more of their sensory inputs underdeveloped or 
hyperdeveloped. Our son is a highly sensory-seeking boy who needs frequent, strong feedback from
his senses of taste, touch, smell and proprioception. This high need for sensory input is sometimes related 
to searching for pleasure and other times as a coping mechanism for underlying anxiety. 

2. **Communication** Persons with autism often have some level of difficulty developing their verbal language. Some 
persons with autism never become verbal; some develop partial verbal ability, while others are perfectly articulate.
My son is developing his speaking skills. He can communicate his needs and wants with one or two
words and uses a visual communication book to express more complex needs. It still is sometimes difficult for him
to communicate to us parents what he feels or needs.

3. **Social interaction** Persons with autism often find interacting with other people hard, stressful and anxiety-inducing.
High-functioning individuals with autism are often mostly affected by this aspect of the autism spectrum and sometimes don't
even manifest it outwardly in public spaces. We have heard anecdotes of parents with children in this part of the spectrum
saying that their child uses their public persona at school to behave very differently at home, where they can relieve
themselves of the stress of living that public persona.

4. **Learning difficulties** A portion of the population in the autism spectrum has learning disabilities. My son attends a
special school, and their curriculum is tailored to each pupil. My son's curriculum is theoretically based on the national UK. But when I compare it to the curriculum of our 10-year-old daughter, they look nowhere like the same.

5. **Challenging behaviour** I recently read some statistics about challenging behaviour and autism, and the percentages are
relatively high, especially among children with autism who also have learning difficulties.
Suppose you are wondering what the term challenging behaviour means in reality. In that case, it is pushing and shoving others, pulling hair, slapping, 
kicking, throwing things and many other behaviours that you would define naughty, if not worse, to a non-neurodivergent person. For persons with autism, this behaviour is often a form of communication
when they are in distress and/or a consequence of being overwhelmed by the world around them.

6. **Mood management** Persons with autism often find it difficult to manage their mood. Indeed, the
challenging behaviour I mentioned is highly linked to this difficulty in finding 
the proper balance. Anxiety and distress are experienced more often than in neurotypical people. As coping 
mechanisms, many people in the autistic spectrum display repetitive behaviours. Sometimes, this emerges
as short, frequent loops of the same sequence of actions repeated repeatedly, sometimes in more extended 
patterns of behaviour that may not be obvious at first glance. As an example, we have recently realised
that my son, when visiting a new place, like a holiday home, feels the need to create his own space, his own nest, where
he can retire and be undisturbed by others. Once he has that space, he will regularly retire to it during the day and
prefers to be on his own before coming out to do a new activity.

7. **No sense of danger**. This is not true for all autistic people, but oh gosh, is it something that affects our family.
When discussing autism in general, it probably wouldn't be one of the points that make it to the main bullet point
list, but as a parent, keeping my son safe is one of the most stress-inducing and constant thoughts in my wife and my mind. 

I said it would be a brief outline, so I will stop here. My understanding could be articulated for a bit
longer, but I have outlined the main aspects.

As I follow up on my pledge, my intention is to articulate more fully this understanding in the
future autism section of the website. 

[^1]: If you are puzzled by the fact that I do a pledge, it's based on some
tips I read a few years ago. If you want to increase the chances of bringing a project
to fruition, announcing it to others may help. It puts some social pressure on yourself.
Sounds reasonable. If you do it constantly, does it not
dilute its power? Luckily, I've rarely made these kinds of pledges and promises.
