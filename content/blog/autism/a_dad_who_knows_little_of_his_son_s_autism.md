My son Adrian is seven and a half years old. Earlier I was thinking about what to
write about in this website, and an obvious topic is life as a parent of an
autistic child who has severe learning difficulties.

Shame, an old friend who frequently pays a visit, told me that
indeed I know far too little about autism to talk with any authority about it.
Well, I can act as a sample, perhaps, and some of the tips I discovered
or was taught may work for other parents, but that's about it.

So, bypassing the regrets on my late start on the topic, thanking 
yet again my wife Evi for being much more switched on in her role as a parent
than I am -she has read and is reading plenty about autism- I promise
myself to be better in the months and years to come.

And I want to do it concretely. So that's my pledge to myself [^1], made public
to the internet and to my friend Shame for when he visits again in the future:

~~~
Today I will briedly summarise what I understand of autims,
after seven and a half year of parenting of our autistic son.

I will, in the next 3 years, gain a better understanding of what
the current scientific consensus, thinking and current research
directions are around autism, especially in terms of what
interventions have received empirical support or are looking 
promising.

Once every three months I will report the progress here, and will 
try to synthesise my finding in a separate section of the website,
together with a directory of the resources I've discovered during 
my research.

## My current understanding of autism

I will try to briefly summarise what my understanding of autism is as of today.
When I say that this is my current understanding, what I'm trying to convey is that I'm
uncertain about its validity. It runs potentially contrary to what the current scientific and educational
consensus are, given how relatively little I know about it.

This summary is informed by:
1. My day-to-day life as a dad with an autistic son.
2. Second hand knowledge from my diligent wife Evi.
3. Tips and tricks picked from other parents, educators and health professionals.
4. Very limited reading from parenting books focused on children with autism.
5. Very limited research on Google Scholar about scientific literature around autism.

Autism is a condition with a wide-spectrum, that affects the social and cognitive abilities of a person
in a number of ways:

1. **Underdeveloped or hyperdevloped sensory input** Persons with autism often have  one or more of their sensory inputs underdeveloped or 
hyperdeveloped. Our son is a highly sensory-seeking boy, who needs frequent, strong feedback from
his senses of taste, touch, smell and proprioception. This high need of sensory input is sometimes related 
to searching for pleasure, and other times as coping mechanism from underlying anxiety. 
2. **Communication** Persons with autism often have some level of difficulty in their verbal language development. Some 
persons with autism never become verbal, some develop some level of verbal ability, while others are perfectly articulate.
Adrian is developing his verbal abilities. At this point in time he can communicate his needs and wants with one or two
words, and uses a visual communication book to express more complex needs. It still is sometimes difficult for him
to communicate to us parents what he feels or needs.
3. **Social interaction** Persons with autism often find interacting with other people hard, stressful and anxiety-inducing.
High-functioning individuals with autism are often mostly affected by this aspect of autism spectrum, and sometime don't
even manifest it outwardly in public spaces. We have heard anecdotes of parents with children in this part of the spectrum,
saying that their child uses their public persona at school, to then behaving very differently at home, where they can relieve
themselves of the stress of living that public persona.
4. **Learning difficulties** A portion of the population in the autism spectrum has learning disabilities. Adrian goes to a
special school, and their curriculum is tailored to each pupil. It is based on the national UK curriculum, but in reality is
very different from the curriculum our daughter Arianna, 10 years old at the moment of writing, followed at Adrian's age.
5. **Challenging behaviour** I recently read some statistics about challenging behaviour and autism, and the percentages are
quite high, especially among children with autism who also have learning difficulties.
If you are wondering what the term challenging behaviour means in reality, it is pushing and shoving others, pulling hair, slapping, 
kicking, throwing things and many other behaviours that you would define naughty if not worse to a non
neurodivergent person. For persons with autism this behaviour is often a form of communication
when they are in distress, and/or a consequence of being overwhelmed by the world around them.
6. **Mood management** Persons with autism often find it difficult to manage their mood. Indeed the
challenging behaviour I just mentioned is highly linked to this difficulty in finding 
proper balance. Anxiety and distress are experience more often that in neurotypical people. As coping 
mechanisms, many people in the autistic spectrum display repetitive behaviours. Sometimes this emerges
as short, frequent loops of the same sequence of actions repeated over and over again, sometimes in longer 
patterns of behaviour that may not be obvious at first glance. As an example, we have recently come to realise
that Adrian, when visiting a new place, like a holiday home, feels the need to create his own space, his own nest, where
he can retire and be undisturbed by others. Once he has that space, he will regularly, during the day, retire to it and
prefer to be on his own, before coming out to do a new activity.
7. **No sense of danger**. This is not true for all autistic people, but oh gosh is it something that affects our family.
When discussing autism in general it probably wouldn't be one of the points that make it to the main bullet point
list, but, as a parent, keeping Adrian safe is one of the most stress-inducing and constant thoughts is my wife and my minds. 

Now I said it was going to be a brief outline, so I will stop here. My understanding could be articulated for a bit
longer, but I have outlined what I belive are the main aspects.

As I follow up on my pledge, my intention is to articulate more fully on this understanding in the
future autism section of the website. 

[^1]: If you are puzzled by the fact that I do a pledge, well it's based on some
tip I read a few years ago. If you want to increase the chances of bring a project
to fruition, announcing to other may help. It puts some social pressure on yourself.
Sounds reasonable I suppose. I do wonder, though, if you do it all the time, does it not
dilute its power? Luckily, so far, I've done these kind of pledges and promises not
too often.
