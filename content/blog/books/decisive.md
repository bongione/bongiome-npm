I had a pleasant time listening to this audiobook. My son also loved it - well the drone of it I suppose, it
helped him stay settled during our evening drives before he settled in bed.

The book was originally published in 2012 - 2013, and it's interesting to listen to it a few years later,
because some of the studies it mentions I suspect have been revealed as invalid since.

Having said that, most of the advice still sounds sensible enough, worth keeping in mind when you face 
non-trivial decisions.

They suggest a four steps approach to decisions, to try and work around our natural cognitive biases from
making as make poorer decisions than we have to.

1. Widen your options. When you face a decision, and especially when the decision is a binary one, check if there are additional
options.
2. Reality check your assumptions. For most decisions and the possible options, there should be a way to look for both
positive and negative evidence. Look for it.
3. Attain distance. Often a decision is tough because we are emotionally and intellectually invested in it. Attaining
distance through time, pretending to be your successor, supposing it is your best friend who's taking the decision and you're asked to advise them, what advice would you give them? 
4. Prepare to be wrong. Even better decisions will turn out to not work out, that's the nature of an uncertain
future. But by thinking ahead of how you will leave if things go wrong, you will be better prepared and probably
also make a choice you can live with even if it gots wrong.

- Multitracking
- Ooch
- 10 10 10
- Think what your successor would do
  - reframing seems also to be part of what a psychologist does, it changes the way you reflect on yourself,
  your beliefs and you actions
- Prentend it's you friend making the decision and that you are giving advice

Of the various 
like should I
stay or leave my partner, or should I stay at my job or look somewhere else, you may look if there are other
options worth investigating. Continuing on the previous example about leaving your partner or not, another option could 
be to discuss your doubts about your relationship with your partner ant try to change route, or suggest couple therapy.
In terms of your job you could perhaps investigate if changes to you current role, or department assignments are also possible.
