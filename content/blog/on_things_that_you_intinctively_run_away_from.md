There are thing I instinctively run away from:
- You are doing things wrong, here is your chatgpt cheat sheets
- I want to share that I am starting my new....
- Influencers

But I want to dig a bit deeper into why I may do that, how not to completely ignore it, how to
avoid discovering opportunities because of some aversion.
