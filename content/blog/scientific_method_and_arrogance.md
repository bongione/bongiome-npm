I had a session of coaching today, it was confronting, fun, thought-provoking, threat affective system
activating.

One of the questions I posed myself is, not for the first time, what is the theoretical underpinning
of coaching as a practice, and what scientific evidence is there to validate its effectiveness?

I think the question can be asked and is valid, but I personally do have a tendency to dismiss those
things that have not been scrutinized via the scientific method. 

And I finally had a second thought, there is plenty out there that happens in the workd that hasn't
scientific backing or scrutiny, still happens and will continue to happen, with or without scientific 
backing: making business decisions, creating new products, organising family life, having discussions
with peers, stragers, mentors. I feel I'm also missing something more blatantly visible and permeating
my life, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

The point I finally internalise is that you cannot dismiss something because it does not have scientific
evidence. I prefer if there is validation to be had, and solid validation at that, but it's not always
possible. Also I have a hunch, and I could be proven wrong, that often science catches up to what has
already happened in the *real world*.

I've come to this realisation partly because, in my day to day life, I have the pleasure of
raising two splendid kids with my wife, one of which is autistic with learning difficulties.
Scientific evidence in the approaches to deal with the needs and behaviours related with autism is 
not massive, so often we try strategies that I find questionable at a first view, yet I try them, and
if they seem to work, I will keep using them unless something more effective comes around.

You could also argue that experimenting until you find something that works is a form of science. But
to be proper science it needs to be repeatable and possible to falsify. Also, as a coder, I don't like
doing something that seems to work, but I'm not quite sure it does - it happens more often than you'd think in
the coding world.

So there I am, it is time now to research what other minds have made of these questions in the past, summarise
the main points raised, and come to a more articulate conclusion for myself.
