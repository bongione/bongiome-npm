I'm an unrelenting pusher. No, not I don't push drugs. I push my products and ideas to people, instead
of looking for their pain points and create solutions to real problems.

I do believe in the pulling approach. It makes so much sense. I tried doing it. Sincerely. Well, maybe
asking my colleagues to do it for me, but I tried for a bit.

The big problem is that to do the pulling, you need to conduct the type of activities I don't really enjoy.
Network, meet people, build relationships.

I'm ambivert, I don't mind meeting new people, but as an unrelentless habit, far too draining for my lone
wolf spirit. So I'm deciding to go for broke.

I will multi-track! [Decisive]() mentions that as a great way to explore multiple options. In terms of a Saas it
feels like crazy. The thing is, I spent time and effort to build something, give it a chance to survive.
If I buile enough tools, and some people start to use any of the products, some of the others will start
to get attention, and maybe also be criticized, or given feeback on.

I avoid spamming people with stuff they don't care about, only once they start caring they start talking to me.

I'm not saying no marketing at all, content marketing will stay a main stay of what we do.

My new motto is value in everything we do. If you land on our pages, I hope you don't go away regretting
wasting your time - well unless you were looking for something different, in which case the search engine
that didn't understand your search intent is to blame.

So my apologies if I push my ideas of what is fun, what is good for you, what works. If a few of you find the
tools we build useful, that will be enough for giving our efforts meaning.

And we will definitely listen to you! You don't like how this works, let's dig into why, how can we make it
work. We are actually eager to be pulled. But how to kickstart the pulling is the hard part, and we decide
to try pushing before you push us back.

Part of me wonders, am I fooling the sensible part of myself, am I making something sound good to overcome
rational objections to such an initiative? Am I convincing myself to be knowingly foolish? Perhaps. Yes, there
is a good chance. At least I'm testing it out in real life, I'm putting some skin in the game.
Not so much financially as emotionally and my sense of self-worth.

But let's do the 10 - 10 - 10. What will I think of this decision in 10 minutes. I will still feel
the positive glow of having taken a decision, lightened, it's done, let's go for it.
What will I think in 10 months? I will be either elated, because things are going well, depressed, because
I'm not going pushed back, or somewhere in between. This will be the less certain.
In 10 years? If thing go well, I will still probably be writing similar blog posts and push yet more egotistical
ideas onto the defensless rest of humanity. Talk about egomaniacs. If things go badly I will probably
be pursuing some other megalomaniac project - perhaps finally writing my fantasy saga of tens of books - and
having made of this experience a decision a good anecdote and wisdom to share with friends and family.

But I went into it knowing it could go badly. I will suffer if it goes bad, no doubt about it. But if I've
learned anything about my past failures, is that they often brought good learning and eventual good outcomes
too. I will write more about the topic at another time.
