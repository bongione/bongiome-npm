The post is about how I feel eight years in on a startup that cost quite a bit of money and has little
to show for it.
Of errors I made and errors I plan to keep making, and blindness to it, and smart thinking, and feeling
inadequate, and things I like doing and things I don't like doing.
On what the plan is for now and what after. About cages we build for ourselves, about the unknown, about
dissociation and flight.
