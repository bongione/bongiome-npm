Hi, I'm Paolo Ferdinando Bongiovanni. Thanks for visiting!

Be warned, most of what follows has my brand of humour: hard to understand - yeah, I'm always puzzled that my jokes fall flat-
and hard to decide  if I'm being serious or not. If in doubt, I was probably attempting to be facetious. 

## Born an immigrant, emigration was in the blood early on - 1977/1980

I was born in far 1977, on November 25th. It happened in Belgium, where
my mum is from originally. She took the bet of marrying an Italian immigrant 7 year her
senior, even after he initially lied about his age.

At the time of writing at least, they are still happily married.

We lived in Belgium for three years after my birth, welcoming my sister
Giusy when I was 2. Then my father received the fateful call from the
Italian state railways. He was going to be a train driver!

## The Italian years - 1980/2002

So we moved to Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. When people ask him where I'm from, and I answer Brighton,
and they say, no, I mean originally, and I say London, and they say nooo, for gosh sake, hear your accent man,
and I eventually relent, I tell them that my parents live in the north-east of Italy, not far from Venice,
on the border with Slovenia.

It's a lovely part of Italy: it has seaside, mountains, good food, lovely wine. Some may challenge me on the good
food part. My wife and I like it, so there you have it.

The interesting fact about the place I grew up in is that my dad's family live about as far from there as my mum's family
in Belgium. You see, I left something out of my initial telling of the story. Where is my dad from you ask?
Think of dead horse's heads in your bed on a cold morning, and you'll have your answer.

I had a perfectly pleasant and safe childhood, got a second sister called Natalie when I was nine, did well in 
primary and middle school, started high-school horribly, repeating my first year in a less demanding environment after
hitting for the first time the wall between my lazy intelligence and places that required me to abandon that laziness.

Once I changed I got back to more acing my classes without much effort till it was time for university. But in those
crucial years something very important happened. My inner nerd awoke, consumed me, possessed me. I was an avid
tabletop roleplaying player, and I developed my deepest friendships that are still strong nearly 30 years onwards.

Then it was time for university, where I discovere yet again that being smartish but lazy is not enought when you are 
surrounded by many brains, a number of them with better hardware, software and switched on more often than yours.

So I struggled at university, until I discovered I could go abroad for a period of my student life. And so off off I went,
never to look back.

## The Belgian years - 2002 / 2005

I went back to half of my roots, Belgium, in the ancient university town of Leuven.
There I met a lot of amazing friends, some of whom I still frequent 20 years since, and a very
special Belgian lady, who lived a couple of miles from where I lived when we were babies.
If that's not destiny, what is?!

How did I seduce that young lovely lady, who is now my loving wife? The Italian way: food and wine.
It's a surprisingly strong combo, it pretty much remains the bedrock of our relationship more than 20 years
after it started.
